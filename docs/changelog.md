## 2026-07-25 — the start menu picks the map

Ethan: *"we will need a redesign of the initial menu to allow you to select
both map and normal versus fun and kind of redesign to make it look better
anyway."* There are two worlds now and no way to reach the second one except by
typing `?theme=void` into the address bar, which is not a menu.

The overlay is now one dispatch panel with two named choices — **ROUTE** (which
world) above **RULES** (how the cuff behaves) — a start button, and the keybind
table demoted from the biggest object on screen to a six-chip strip plus a
disclosure. Each map card carries its own inline-SVG thumbnail in its own
colours, so the warm archipelago and the cold violet void are told apart at a
glance whichever one is booted.

Three things this had to get right and did:

- **The map change reloads, and says so.** The theme is baked into the IBL, a
  33^3 grade LUT and every material at boot, so there is no honest live swap.
  The unpicked card is labelled `RELOADS`, the pick lights immediately, the
  panel dims behind an `ENTERING THE VOID` notice, and only then does the page
  go. `?theme=` is rewritten alongside the stored key, because the URL param
  outranks storage on the next boot and a stale one would silently undo the
  choice.
- **Picking something is not starting the run.** The overlay's own click takes
  pointer lock; the guard that kept difficulty cards from dropping you into the
  course now covers the map cards and the controls disclosure too. Focus is also
  dropped when the lock is taken, or Enter mid-run would re-fire the last card
  clicked.
- **It is legible over both worlds.** Every word sits on one panel plate, so it
  reads the same over a blown-out golden sky and over a near-black void; only
  the accent colour follows the booted theme (brass, or violet). The HUD is
  deliberately left brass in both — it is an instrument panel, not chrome.

Verified by looking: `tools/menu-shots.mjs` shoots the menu over both themes at
1600x900 and 1280x720 (the 720 case fits with 235 px to spare), and drives the
three behaviours above plus a bare reload. `hideChrome()` still hides `#overlay`
by id, photo mode still frees the cursor without raising the menu, and
`tools/ship-gate.sh` exits 0.

## 2026-07-25 — the underpass left flank was passable

Reported: *"at the underpass you can go LEFT and leave the play volume
entirely."* Reproduced mechanically before anything was changed, with the new
`tools/containment.mjs` driving the shipped controller through the shipped
collision world: **27 of 144 scripted runs left the deck's -Z edge below the
top of the balustrade**, e.g. sliding in at 11 m/s and steering left put the
body through the rail at `x=133.63, y=0.34, z=-8.38` and off the edge at
`x=135.24, z=-9.57`, then into free fall.

- **`src/kit.js` — `balustrade()` now declares the baluster band's collider.**
  This is the root cause and it is a hard-rule-2 violation: the turned
  balusters are drawn with `L.mesh`, which is visual-only by construction, so
  every balustrade in the course had colliders under its plinth (0.34 m) and
  inside its top rail (1.28 m) and a **0.94 m collision hole in between**. A
  standing capsule is 1.75 m and is stopped by the rail, so nobody found it;
  the 0.95 m *sliding* capsule that the underpass's 1.35 m ceiling **forces**
  you into steps onto the plinth for free and passes straight through a barrier
  the player can see. Fixed with one `solid(..., { hidden: true })` slab per
  run, baluster-deep — at the widest pitch this kit emits the clear gap is
  0.66 m against a 0.68 m capsule, so the run was already impassable in
  fiction. `ghost` runs are unaffected.
- **`src/level.js` — the underpass's -Z balustrade starts at the island edge**
  (`x=123`, length 26) instead of at the lintel, so the whole left flank from
  the checkpoint through the slot is closed by architecture rather than by 8 m
  of bare edge. It still stops at `x=149`: the apron past it is where the
  `low-7` branch dashes in over the void, and a parapet there would delete an
  authored route.
- **`tools/containment.mjs`** — the probe, kept. `reachability.mjs` proves you
  can get everywhere the course intends; nothing proved you could not get
  *out*. Now **0 of 144 runs** cross the flank below the rail. Exits over the
  top of the rail and off the lintel roof are counted and deliberately allowed
  — the roof is play space, the climb verb goes up a 1.6 m parapet by design,
  and falls are recoverable.

No tuning constant was touched; the movement set is byte-identical.
`node tools/reachability.mjs` still PASSes with all 22 checkpoints chained
without dash or grapple, and `bash tools/ship-gate.sh` exits 0.

## 2026-07-25 — geometry unlock, vegetation, instrumentation, audio

Shipped as `78603ac`. Four parallel workstreams; the commit message named only
three of them, so recording the fourth here.

- **`src/props.js`** — real curved geometry. Lathed shafts and domes, radiating
  arch voussoirs, swept tubes, involute gear teeth, chamfered boxes, and a
  noise-displaced blob for rounded rock. Nothing has to be a stacked box now.
- **`src/foliage.js`** — instanced alpha-tested vegetation off a procedurally
  generated atlas, with vertex-shader wind. Vegetation is roughly 40% of the
  reference by screen area and the game previously had none.
- **`src/kit.js`** — rebuilt on both. Turned balusters, columns with real
  base/shaft/capital, ivy on every lip, moss in the junctions.
- **`src/hud.js` + `index.html`** — brass instrumentation, and wayfinding now
  exists: an edge chevron that orbits the frame perimeter and cannot enter the
  centre, a bearing rose, an altimeter tape, checkpoint pips, and ability lamps
  with real lit/unlit contrast. Needs `hud.setNav(camera, level)` from main.js.
- **`src/audio.js`** — surface-aware cues (the contact material was never
  published on the player, so audio reads the collision world itself), six
  mix buses with ducking, a procedurally generated stereo impulse response with
  frequency-dependent decay, a ray-probe driving reverb wet from 0.05 in open
  sky to ~0.4 in a corridor, and a clockwork layer that free-wheels when you
  leave the ground. Output is soft-clipped so clipping is structurally
  impossible.

Measured: 1.23M triangles at 52–65 draw calls, 4.3–11 ms/frame, all eight
harness shots rendering with no clipping low.

**Not verified:** how the audio actually sounds. It was checked structurally
against a mock Web Audio graph — node counts, gain ranges, voice budgets, IR
decay — but nobody has listened to it.

## 2026-07-25

- **Graphics push closed out at 52/100.** A baseline critique scored the game
  AMATEUR 24/100. Two adversarial rounds of specialist work against that
  critique brought the critics' average to 52/100 — competent, not good, and
  the remaining gap is written up as the "round three" list in
  `docs/roadmap.md` rather than being claimed as done.

  What landed and is visible in the shot set: the architecture kit is actually
  placed (15.6k → ~986k triangles at ~43 draw calls, 2.9–5.4 ms/frame), the
  surface material gained macro relief, two-band macro variation, world-planar
  projection and height-preserving de-tiling, and the render pipeline gained
  screen-space contact shadows, analytic sky IBL through PMREM, a procedural
  grade LUT and a warm aerial-perspective term. `tools/shotset.mjs` captures
  and measures 8 named gameplay poses in one launch, which is the only reason
  any of this could be judged.

  What did not land, honestly: there is still no cloud sea — the deck shader in
  `SKY_FRAG` assumes a deck one unit below the camera and produces a single
  screen-filling blob, so `vista.png` is a flat khaki gradient where the brief
  asks for "a sea of golden sunset clouds". Nothing in any frame is dark (0.00%
  clipped low on all eight shots, p1 between 38.8 and 57.4). The lit walking
  deck is mint-teal against peach risers, because the grade's shadow tint keys
  on display luminance rather than on the lighting term. Brass is one flat
  mustard value with no crevice darkening. Every island shares one silhouette
  and the undersides are countable cubes. `SURFACE.brass.glint` was pulled
  1.5 → 1.15 to stop the balustrades clipping; measurement says it did not move
  `underpass.png`'s 2.77% clipped-high at all, so that cause is still unfound.

- Movement: you can steer a jump now, and a double jump stops catapulting you.
  Air control was Quake `accelerate()` alone, which can only add speed along the
  wish direction and barely bends the arc at 20 m/s; steering is now a separate
  magnitude-preserving rotation at a speed-widening turn rate (75.8° in half a
  second at sprint). The air jump was assigning full current speed to the new
  direction, firing you sideways at 20 m/s; it now blends heading halfway
  (52.9°, magnitude preserved). The two mechanisms are kept separate so steering
  can never become a speed exploit — one second of hard alternating air input
  gains 0.15 m/s.

- Firebase Hosting target added — `npm run deploy` builds and ships to
  https://skyline-courier-5329.web.app, playable by anyone with the link.
  Hosting only, no Firebase SDK in the bundle; see `docs/deploy.md`. Source
  now also lives in the private repo `Calculator5329/skyline-courier`.
- Created the project. Vite 7 + Three.js r180, no other runtime dependencies.
  Successor to the parked `games/clockwork-garden`; carries over its fiction
  (the wind-up courier), palette, and taste rules, and drops the Unreal +
  generated-3D-asset pipeline that stalled it.
