- **Graphics push closed out at 52/100.** A baseline critique scored the game
  AMATEUR 24/100. Two adversarial rounds of specialist work against that
  critique brought the critics' average to 52/100 — competent, not good, and
  the remaining gap is written up as the "round three" list in
  `docs/roadmap.md` rather than being claimed as done.

  What landed and is visible in the shot set: the architecture kit is actually
  placed (15.6k → ~986k triangles at ~43 draw calls, 2.9–5.4 ms/frame), the
  surface material gained macro relief, two-band macro variation, world-planar
  projection and height-preserving de-tiling, and the render pipeline gained
  screen-space contact shadows, analytic sky IBL through PMREM, a procedural
  grade LUT and a warm aerial-perspective term. `tools/shotset.mjs` captures
  and measures 8 named gameplay poses in one launch, which is the only reason
  any of this could be judged.

  What did not land, honestly: there is still no cloud sea — the deck shader in
  `SKY_FRAG` assumes a deck one unit below the camera and produces a single
  screen-filling blob, so `vista.png` is a flat khaki gradient where the brief
  asks for "a sea of golden sunset clouds". Nothing in any frame is dark (0.00%
  clipped low on all eight shots, p1 between 38.8 and 57.4). The lit walking
  deck is mint-teal against peach risers, because the grade's shadow tint keys
  on display luminance rather than on the lighting term. Brass is one flat
  mustard value with no crevice darkening. Every island shares one silhouette
  and the undersides are countable cubes. `SURFACE.brass.glint` was pulled
  1.5 → 1.15 to stop the balustrades clipping; measurement says it did not move
  `underpass.png`'s 2.77% clipped-high at all, so that cause is still unfound.

- Movement: you can steer a jump now, and a double jump stops catapulting you.
  Air control was Quake `accelerate()` alone, which can only add speed along the
  wish direction and barely bends the arc at 20 m/s; steering is now a separate
  magnitude-preserving rotation at a speed-widening turn rate (75.8° in half a
  second at sprint). The air jump was assigning full current speed to the new
  direction, firing you sideways at 20 m/s; it now blends heading halfway
  (52.9°, magnitude preserved). The two mechanisms are kept separate so steering
  can never become a speed exploit — one second of hard alternating air input
  gains 0.15 m/s.

- Firebase Hosting target added — `npm run deploy` builds and ships to
  https://skyline-courier-5329.web.app, playable by anyone with the link.
  Hosting only, no Firebase SDK in the bundle; see `docs/deploy.md`. Source
  now also lives in the private repo `Calculator5329/skyline-courier`.
- Created the project. Vite 7 + Three.js r180, no other runtime dependencies.
  Successor to the parked `games/clockwork-garden`; carries over its fiction
  (the wind-up courier), palette, and taste rules, and drops the Unreal +
  generated-3D-asset pipeline that stalled it.
