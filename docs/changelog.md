# Changelog

## 2026-07-25

- Firebase Hosting target added — `npm run deploy` builds and ships to
  https://skyline-courier-5329.web.app, playable by anyone with the link.
  Hosting only, no Firebase SDK in the bundle; see `docs/deploy.md`. Source
  now also lives in the private repo `Calculator5329/skyline-courier`.
- Created the project. Vite 7 + Three.js r180, no other runtime dependencies.
  Successor to the parked `games/clockwork-garden`; carries over its fiction
  (the wind-up courier), palette, and taste rules, and drops the Unreal +
  generated-3D-asset pipeline that stalled it.
